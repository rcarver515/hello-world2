This is a practice project to learn Git.
After finishing Vandy Bootcamp I have finally decided to go back through the course and review and "re-learn" the road to full-stack development. 
So far, I have revisited HTML, CSS, the command line and now Git (version control). My plan is to now utilize codecademy and VCB activities to aid me in my journey.
